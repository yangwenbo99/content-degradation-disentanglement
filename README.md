Please visit our project page for more details and the trained models.

## TODOs

- [x] Make the simplified code public
- [x] Test the code on newer Compute Canada clusters
- [x] Release training configs
- [x] Release trained models
- [ ] Release test instructions
- [ ] Release demo notebooks
- [ ] Add an open-source licence (we need to figure out what licence we may use first)
